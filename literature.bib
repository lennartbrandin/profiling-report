	abstract = {Large complex programs are composed of many small routines that implement abstractions for the routines that call them. To be useful, an execution profiler must attribute execution time in a way that is significant for the logical structure of a program as well as for its textual decomposition. This data must then be displayed to the user in a convenient and informative way. The
              gprof
              profiler accounts for the running time of called routines in the running time of the routines that call them. The design and use of this profiler is described.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a survey of various tools that can be used to aid in performance analysis of computer software programs. We present and discuss different techniques in emerging performance analysis tools as well as provide examples of each type of method. For example, we will cover simple techniques such as timer routines with manual instrumentation to statistical profiling tools and more advanced dynamic instrumentation techniques, in which code can be monitored and changed on the fly. Additionally, a brief comparison of the tools will be presented with some tradeoff considerations.},
