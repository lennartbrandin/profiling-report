  abstract: [
    Performance profiling is a method of analyzing where execution time is spent. 
    Using profiling tools, it is possible to locate performance hotspots @bernecky_profiling_1989 which are "sections of code that, if optimized, would yield the best overall speed-up." @graham_gprof_1982 \
    To achieve this, the written user code is executed and recorded as a call graph, i. e. the relationship between a function and those it is calling. Such a recording can provide information about the number of calls and time spent in each function.

= Introduction

== Motivation

== Usage of electronic tools
- Typst - General Visualization framework
- VSCode - Editing && Debugging
- #gls-short("TUHH") typst ies-report template
- Google Scholar - Source discovery
- Generative AI - ChatGPT acquiring topic outline, source discovery
- Generative AI - Github Copilot code autocomplete, not used for writing passges

= Preliminaries

= Conclusion

Using an abbreviation like #gls("TUHH") is a good idea.
